## Example shell for `spago`-based workflow

### Overview and important notes

`spago` README.md is provides an excellent guide to using the tool together with other PS/JS ecosystem tools.
* [spacchetti/spago: PureScript package manager and build tool powered by Dhall and package-sets](https://github.com/spacchetti/spago#package-management)

It is important to note that `spago` is replacing the combination of  `pulp`, `psc-package`, `purp` together with bower, but it does not do the final packaging (into the corresponding html-js combo), not does it provides commands for serving the result. There are several alternative tools for this stage, but `parcel-bundle` (`ParcelJS`) is proffered at the time of writing.

# spago.dhall


# Append psci-support package to spago.dhall
patch spago.dhall spago.dhall.patch
# where
cat ./spago.dhall.patch
```

```diff
8c8
<     [ "effect", "console" ]
---
>     [ "effect", "console", "psci-support" ]
```

```sh
spago install
# Creates .spago/

spago build
# creates output/

# RUN
